## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Fixed DESCRIPTION so package names are in single quotes
* In the initial submission I was advised to check the R/utilities-ggplot2.R
  file to verify that it does not modify the .GlobalEnv. I checked this file and
  confirmed that it does not modify the .GlobalEnv.
